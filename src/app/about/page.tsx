              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                Calorie Tracker was founded in 2021 by a team of nutritionists, fitness experts, and software developers who recognized a significant gap in the market: most nutrition apps failed to understand Indian dietary habits and regional cuisines.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                As health-conscious Indians ourselves, we struggled with international apps that didn't recognize our staple foods or provide accurate nutritional information for Indian dishes. We set out to build a solution specifically designed for the Indian population.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                After two years of research, development, and testing with thousands of users across India, we've created a nutrition tracking platform that truly understands the unique needs of Indians striving for better health.
